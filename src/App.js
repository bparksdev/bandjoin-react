        Musical relationships can be as intense<br />and all-consuming as romantic ones.&nbsp;

            There are fights, hurt feelings, storming out of the room, and the occasional "silent treatment". But also times of
            unbridled bliss and harmony that you wouldn't trade for the world.
            <br /><br />
            Wouldn't it be <strong>great</strong> if we handled relationships between musicians in the same way we handle romantic ones online?
            With thoughtful consideration of a musician's <em>likes and dislikes, aspirations, personal style, preferences, and skills</em> and how those match up (or not) with another individual?

      <Text400>What is the Musician Compatibility Engine â„¢?</Text400>
      <Text250>Glad you asked! The MCE is a tool that allows an artist to find similar (or disimilar) artists based on several weighted comparison algorithms - exclusive to BandJoin.</Text250>
      <Text250>We give you a definitive compatibility rating based on the information in your profile to find your musical soul mate.</Text250>
